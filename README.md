<br/>

I am a bioinformatician working in the field of computational genomics. Since the beginning of my career, I have mainly focused on developing methods for the analysis of long-read data. More recently, my interests have also expanded into pagenomics.
Programming is one of my passions, and most of my code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidebolo1993). I currently work at [Human Technopole](https://humantechnopole.it/en/), a leading research institution for molecular biology.
My publications are listed on:
 - [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-MqrVqkAAAAJ)
 - [Web of Science](https://publons.com/researcher/3146528/davide-bolognini)
 - [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8735-8093)
 
If you need assistance with any of my software, have a feature request, or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out to [me](mailto:davidebolognini7@gmail.com) or open a GitHub issue.
